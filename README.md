# Cablab

Development, improvement and testing of various reinforcement learning algorithms. <br>
Focus is on finding an effective algorithm for the cabworld. The algorithms can also be applied to all other OpenAiGym environments.

## Cabworld

In the cabworld a cab is driving around and tries to pick-up passengers to drive them to their destination.
Each passenger is marked with the same color as his destination. <br>

## Currently implemented Algorithms

1. DQN
5. MDQN
2. A2C
3. PPO
4. MA-PPO (individual)

## Subtasksâ€‹

The cabworld is a relativly complex environment with different subtasks which can be seperated

### Subtask 1: Learn movements

### Subtask 2: Learn pick-ups

### Subtask 3: Learn to select passengers
